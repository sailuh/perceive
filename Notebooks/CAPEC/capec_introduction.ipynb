The CAPEC 2.9 XML file used and its accompanying XML Schema Documentation are both available for download on the website [CAPEC website](http://capec.mitre.org/data/index.html) under \"Release Downloads.\" \n",
    "The representation of the data on the [website](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/1000.html) is easier to navigate and easier to make sense of than the XML file.  The website's interface for the Views allows you to easily explore through the developed hierarchical relationships due to the (+) and (-) buttons that allow you to expand the relationships. For this reason, we use the website to gather general information, but rely on the XML file, which contains the bulk of the infomation in a convenient machine-readable form to gather the important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "After initial examination of the file, we found that the XML contained four root nodes: Views, Categories, Attack Patterns, and Environments.  Each of these root nodes contained subnodes, which we refer to as individual **Entries**.  These Entries have identification numbers and contain numerous subnodes of their own, which we call **Fields**.  These Fields contain the organized information regarding the Entry and are the main focus of our investigation.  \n",

As the Categories are ways of sorting Attack Patterns, a given Meta Attack Pattern Entry will be a *MemberOf* two categories, one for each View.  Meta Attack Pattern Entries have *Child* nodes that can be either Standard or Detailed Attack Patterns.  These two abstraction types of Attack Patterns do not have a relationship to the Categories.  Standard Attack Pattern Entries may also have their own Child, which will always be a Detailed Attack Pattern.\n",

To prepare for extracting information from the text within the Attack Pattern Fields, we must first determine which Fields appear the most, if the most frequent Fields even contain the most important/relevant pieces of information, and the means by which to extract the information from the XML needed to create a corpus."

There were 24 fields that fit this criterium and 7 fields that did not.  The 7 fields that occur less than 50 times will likely have to be included in our scope of inquiry at a later time since rarity could be an indicator of greater importance rather than lesser, but for now, we have targeted the fields that are voluminous.
