    "CAPEC displays its data in two formats: the [CAPEC Website](http://capec.mitre.org/) and the CAPEC XML file.  The CAPEC 2.9 XML file used and its accompanying XML Schema Documentation are both available for download on the website [CAPEC website](http://capec.mitre.org/data/index.html) under \"Release Downloads.\" \n",
    "The representation of the data on the [website](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/1000.html) is easier to navigate and easier to make sense of than the XML file.  The website's interface for the Views allows you to easily explore through the developed hierarchical relationships due to the (+) and (-) buttons that allow you to expand the relationships. For this reason, we use the website to gather general information, but rely on the XML file, which contains the bulk of the infomation in a convenient machine-readable form to gather the important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "After initial examination of the file, we found that the XML contained four root nodes: Views, Categories, Attack Patterns, and Environments.  Each of these root nodes contained subnodes, which we refer to as individual **Entries**.  These Entries have identification numbers and contain numerous subnodes of their own, which we call **Fields**.  These Fields contain the organized information regarding the Entry and are the main focus of our investigation.  \n",

    "Below Category Entries are the Attack Pattern Entries;   It is important to note that there are three types of Attack Pattern Entries: Meta, Standard, and Detailed.  These three terms refer to the level of abstraction in the particular Attack Pattern Entries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Meta Attack Pattern Entries are directly below Category Entries in the hierarchy and have the *MemberOf* relationship to these Categories.  As the Categories are ways of sorting Attack Patterns, a given Meta Attack Pattern Entry will be a *MemberOf* two categories, one for each View.  Meta Attack Pattern Entries have *Child* nodes that can be either Standard or Detailed Attack Patterns.  These two abstraction types of Attack Patterns do not have a relationship to the Categories.  Standard Attack Pattern Entries may also have their own Child, which will always be a Detailed Attack Pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that Views and Categories are primarily methods of organizing Attack Patterns, we are specifically interested in the Attack Patterns and the Fields that they contain.  To prepare for extracting information from the text within the Attack Pattern Fields, we must first determine which Fields appear the most, if the most frequent Fields even contain the most important/relevant pieces of information, and the means by which to extract the information from the XML needed to create a corpus."

The following Python script uses a list of Fields used by the XML which was created through examining the XML's schema documentation and counts the Fields mentioned to return their frequencies in a dictionary.\n",

    "We encountered a special case within the XML representation where the fields **Summary** and **Attack Execution Flow** were under a container **Description** and would not be counted, despite appearing as unique fields on the HTML representation.  Although there was a **Summary** field in every **Description**, this was not the case for **Attack Execution Flow** and provided an inaccurate representation of the data.  As such, the script takes the **Description** tag as a special case and extracts its children instead.  \n",

    "# Examination of Frequent Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know the frequencies of fields in the Attack Pattern table, our next step for extracting the information from the fields is to determine each field's structure and subsequently, our intended method of text extraction.  For this purpose, we set the line of demarkation at 50 instances and investigated the layout of fields that occurred at least 50 times.  There were 24 fields that fit this criterium and 7 fields that did not.  The 7 fields that occur less than 50 times will likely have to be included in our scope of inquiry at a later time since rarity could be an indicator of greater importance rather than lesser, but for now, we have targeted the fields that are voluminous.  Our findings are reported in the table below.  Type names are subject to change and some minimal differences that have little effect on varying extraction methods have been omitted for initial grouping purposes.\n",

    "Since our ultimate goal is creating a corpus using the content contained in the fields of the Attack Pattern entries, it is therefore important that we explore what type of information is provided by each field type.  Below is a table that lists the fields that occur more than 50 times as well as a description of what information CAPEC provides inside those fields.  Our descriptions are based off of the [schema documentation](https://capec.mitre.org/documents/schema/schema_v2.7.1.html).
