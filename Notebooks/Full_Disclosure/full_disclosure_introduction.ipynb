    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The [PERCEIVE](https://sailuh.github.io/perceive/) project seeks to proactively identify upcoming cybersecurity threats through textual similarity. Social network analysis can be used to partition a network and evaluate its textual content, and hence provide word-selection criteria for defining corpus documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "The subject of this notebook, the [Full Disclosure (FD) mailing list](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/) is a \"public, vendor-neutral forum for detailed discussion of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, as well as tools, papers, news, and events of interest to the community.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Although cybersecurity email mailing lists provide a rich source to identify emerging concepts, they contain a large amount of content that is irrelevant to the project's purpose, including but not limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    " * conference invitations[[1](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Feb/6)]\n",
    " * vendor announcements[[2](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2016/Dec/48)]\n",
    " * extensive conversations on security topics[[3](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2004/Jul/1026)]\n",
    " * a significant amount of trolling[[4](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Apr/96)] \n",
    " * and nonsense[[5](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2009/Jul/289)] [[6](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2004/Jul/796)].\n",
    "\n",
    "As some of this irrelevant content can be strictly tied to its producer, i.e., the **authors** of the **e-mail replies**, social network analysis provides an interesting opportunity for the isolation of relevant discussion topics in order to **filter** non-related vulnerability content. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Network Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier in this project, the FD email lists were developed into networks of edges and nodes, divided by year. These original csv files are available [online](https://mega.nz/#F!CUEByR5I!GY56GzTpYz68IlTqj4aQNQ!fR8jFLxL). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the FD graphs, nodes represent either documents (i.e., emails) or authors, as identified by a nodeType attribute. Edges are directed, representing authorship and replies; edge weight indicates an increasing number of replies. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools used\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gephi \n",
    "\n",
    "While [Gephi](http://gephi.org/) proved useful for data exploration, some difficulties arose. In particular, many of the core functions[[7](https://github.com/jaroslav-kuchar/Social-Network-Analysis/issues/2)] and plugins[[8](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/issues/1481)] once used for social network analysis are not compatible with current (0.9) software versions. Gephi specifications note that the 0.9.0 version (December 2015) \"Removed [the] Clustering module\"[[9](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/releases/tag/v0.9.0)] that these plugins relied upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python-igraph \n",
    "\n",
    "[Python-igraph](http://igraph.org/python/) (igraph hereafter) allows for programmatic manipulation of network data. Igraph can generate images via a `plot` function, but this is a slow process for large graphs. Igraph has a wide variety of import and export options for network data, including straightforward export of subgraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interoperability of Gephi and igraph\n",
    "\n",
    "While Gephi can export graphs, its export implementations include temporary node properties like position and color attributes. Igraph can import Gephi-exported [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/) files (and those are available [here](https://mega.nz/#F!Dpdh2TjD!4Rd462mFXbdFn5Scs1WwUA). However, it was more useful in the long run to generate graphs in igraph directly from the provided edge and node lists. Igraph's exported GraphML files functioned as expected in Gephi.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generating graphs from edge and node lists\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Gephi**, graphs were generated via the `\"import spreadsheet\"` function, and [separate Gephi projects](https://github.com/jeffgerhard/perceive_personal/tree/master/gephi_projects) saved for each year. \n",
    "\n",
    "In **igraph**, graphs are generated via importing csv data into lists, then using igraph's `DictReader` function.\n"

    "## The expansion and contraction of Full Disclosure\n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear from a quick look at the graphs that the overall pattern of the Full Disclosure network has shifted over time. In the early years of the list, there were tightly clustered conversations, particularly from about 2003-2006. As the years went by, the level of discussion seems to have dropped. Some of this pattern can be inferred simply from the file sizes of the edge and node lists, or by counting the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visual impression is further confirmed by a documented change in the FD network in March, 2014, when one of the original managers of the list decided to halt the list entirely[[11](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Mar/332)] but another team soon revived it[[12](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Mar/333)]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following the 2014 format change, the number of edges drops significantly, and the list displays a different network structure from the earlier years. Currently, the list remains active but few members respond to published posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## \"Firework\" patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual analysis of the graphs for each year showed distinct fireworks patterns throughout the lifecycle of the list. These are cases where one author is posting to the list many times, with little or no response from other people on the list, resulting in a hub-and-spoke graph form. The working hypothesis is that these firework patterns generally represent security advisories. If so, these are discussions known issues, and not useful for the project's overall predictive goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "These fireworks were analyzed both visually, in Gephi, and programmatically, in igraph, to test the hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "In **Gephi**, manual examination included use of the [Linkfluence plugin](https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/linkfluence-plugin/) to launch URLs in a web browser directly from nodes studied. This node-by-node analysis demonstrated that firework nodes were security advisories[[13](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Sep/310)][[14](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Apr/291)][[15](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Aug/8)].\n",
    "\n",
    "In **igraph**, it was informative to assess each author node and examine the in-degree of its connected (document) nodes. In cases where all (or most) of an author's neighbors have an in-degree of one, the author is the hub of a firework. "

    "- **Cluster 0** (161 nodes, 183 edges) features a number of discussions of _exploit auctions or sales_[[17](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Jul/93)], [[18](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Jul/116)], [[19](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Nov/226) and includes a  _potential_ firework clustering around user `Nick FitzGerald <nick () virus-l demon co uk>`. A researcher more familiar with security matters should assess whether or not the Nick FitzGerald messages (for example [[20](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Jan/443)], [[21](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Jan/422)], [[22](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Dec/368)]) are valuable for further study; they are primarily general discussions of security topics, in conversation with a wider group of list members.\n",
    "- **Cluster 1** (488 nodes, 983 edges) is heavily dominated by three authors, `Ureleet <ureleet () gmail com>`, `Valdis.Kletnieks () vt edu`, and above all `n3td3v <xploitable () gmail com>`, an infamous list member discussed in several forums even outside of Full Disclosure[[23](http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/managing-infosec/security-trolls-n3td3v-12460)], [[24](http://hackerfactor.com/papers/who_is_n3td3v.pdf)]. n3td3v responds to a wide range of topics including over 300 separate emails in the overall 2008 graph. The fact that these users are not typical makes analysis difficult. The best practice is to treat them as trolls (n3td3v is referred to as a troll in the cited links, with some caveats.) Conveniently, the blob clustering has linked together all of these troll-flavored postings into one giant subgraph of argumentation and flame wars. (Examples of such posts include [[25](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Dec/200)], [[26](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Jun/104)], [[27](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Oct/65)].) This cluster can be dropped from further discussion.\n",
    "- **Cluster 2**, as mentioned earlier, can also be ignored for its small size of 26 nodes.\n",
    "- **Cluster 3** is the largest in the blob (4151 nodes, 4039 edges) and corresponds to the large purple communities in the blob overviews above. This cluster is so large that it is a **candidate for further subdivision**, treating it as yet another 'blob.' It also includes _fireworks_ within its graph. Fireworks within this cluster includ, for example, author ` zdi-disclosures () 3com com` whose postings are in fact security advisories (e.g. [[28](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Apr/83)]. These authors' advisories garnered some responses in the original full-year network and might have been removed with more robust filtering in an earlier stage. For non-firework postings, a manual overview suggests a wide variety of topics in this cluster, including many that touch on the mailing list's central topic, [full-disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure_%28computer_security%29) security postings[[29](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Jan/593)]. [[30](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Apr/554)], [[31](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Jul/147)].\n",
    "- **Cluster 4** is a small subgraph (118 nodes, 138 edges) notable for Windows-focused discussions[[31](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Apr/2), [[32](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Mar/58)], including then-current conversations about Windows Vista in comparison to Windows XP[[31](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Jan/558). There are some additional general discussion of security concerns, but little to make this small group distinct from the overall list.\n",
    "- **Cluster 5** is another small subgraph (145 nodes, 164 edges) with a few dominant authors, similar in some ways to cluster 1. These authors seem to treat the Full Disclosure list as a **social group** as well as a security forum, with email posts featuring titles like \"Came across this site\"[[32](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Sep/118)], \"Anyone have a Lindows/Linspire contact\"[[33](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Apr/558), and \"Southwest Airlines Ticket Silliness\"[[34](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Feb/0)]. Although the members of this clustering discuss security measures, their more broad discussions remove this group from consideration.\n",
    "- **Cluster 6** (21 nodes, 0 edges) is again too small to analyze.\n",
    "- **Cluster 7** (484 nodes, 601 edges) presents a problem for future analysis: the first examples of truly belligerent trolling. In cluster 1 above, n3td3v and other users were extremely active and annoyed others, but did not display overtly antisocial behavior. At least one member of cluster 7 posted offensive[[35](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Apr/22)][[36](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/May/238)] content on a regular basis, while other users here display more aggression[[37](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Jan/504)] or attacks on personal lives[[38](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Feb/123)]. The difficulty in this cluster is assessing the level of discussion of actual security concerns vs. trolling and attacks. This subcluster is thus a strong candidate for **further clustering analysis** which is likely to separate out the authors who engage in malbehavior from the rest of the group.\n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "## A general framework for social network analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The techniques developed above can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "1. Filter out \"firework\" nodes (and the subsequently orphaned nodes that the firework authors originally posted).\n",
    "2. Identify subcommunities within the graph that deserve deeper analysis (e.g., the \"blob\")\n",
    "3. Subdivide into communities again.\n",
    "4. Manually analyze the resulting subgraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy was successful, though incomplete. Two of the resulting subgraphs (numbers 3 and 7 above) merit _further_ subdivision. \n",
    "\n",
    "The results suggest that a more fully-developed programming framework could automate much of this work, as a researcher could discard clusters based on graph structure **or** content, narrowing in on relevant subclusters of subclusters. Early stages of such a framework in Python are suggested above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preliminary results based on the subclusters of the initial \"blob\" are encouraging, demonstrating that social-focused clusters (like cluster 5) and flame-war clusters (like cluster 1) can be isolated from the surrounding graphs through community detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assessing tools used\n",
    "\n",
    "Gephi and igraph were adequate for this research, but both tools are flawed. Alternatives worthy of consideration for future iterations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Cytoscape](http://www.cytoscape.org/) -- comparable to Gephi, but with the potentially useful feature of allowing for publication of graph data as an interactive web page[[38](https://github.com/miriamposner/cytoscape_tutorials/blob/master/publishing-your-network-diagram.md)].\n",
    "- [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/) -- comparable to igraph. The main reason to suggest NetworkX as a potential replacement for igraph is that NetworkX currently has a better-functioning integration with Jupyter notebooks, whereas igraph  faces bugs when attempting to plot images within a notebook[[40](https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph/issues/88).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Suggestions for next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next steps for this analysis should include building out the skeleton Python program above to adhere to _Don't Repeat Yourself_ principles and allow for easy analysis of multiple years of the Full Disclosure list, breaking down huge networks into easily-processed subgraphs.\n",
    "- Jupyter notebooks have strong potential for interactive data analysis, but those hosted on GitHub do not allow for much interactivity[[41](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-jupyter-notebook-files-on-github/)]. An external host, or use of [`nbviewer`](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/), could allow users to generate and manipulate graphs within a notebook.\n",
    "- Rather than relying on static csv edge and node lists, it is possible to pull graph data directly from a database into igraph[[42](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25396799/create-a-directed-weighted-graph-using-python-igraph-and-mysql-results/25412608#25412608)]. As the PERCEIVE project moves in this direction, the social network analysis segment will be able to keep up.\n"
