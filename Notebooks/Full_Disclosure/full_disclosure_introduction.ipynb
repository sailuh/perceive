    "\n",
    "Although cybersecurity email mailing lists provide a rich source to identify emerging concepts, it contains a large amount of content that is irrelevant to the project's purpose, including but not limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    " * conference invitations[[1](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Feb/6)]\n",
    " * vendor announcements[[2](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2016/Dec/48)]\n",
    " * extensive conversations on security topics[[3](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2004/Jul/1026)]\n",
    " * a significant amount of trolling[[4](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Apr/96)] \n",

    "\n",
    "As some of the irrelevant content can be strictly tied to it's producer, i.e., the **authors** of the **e-mail replies**, Social network analysis provides an interesting opportunity for the isolation of relevant discussion topics in order to **filter** non-related vulnerability content. "

(Attempt to import [GML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Modelling_Language) and [Pajek](http://mrvar.fdv.uni-lj.si/pajek/) caused one instance of Python to hang; further investigation would be required to identify a cause.)
