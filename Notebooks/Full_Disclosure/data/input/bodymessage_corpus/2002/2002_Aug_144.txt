Or the vendor for allowing you, the customer, to buy their product? You should be honored by giving your hard earned money to me the vendor. Here take my product and tough shit if it doesn't work well.  How about fuck the vendor. Find a bug, post away 0-day? Or give me money back for the defective product you sold me plus compensation for the time and effort it took me to fix the problems your software did on my machine.I'm just curious, do people on this list think that freeware vendors should be treated differently than this?  Do you think they should be given more (or less) time to address the issues?  How about commercial vendors whose products are open source?  How much does a vendor's past performance (or the perception of past performance) come into play?  - Steve
