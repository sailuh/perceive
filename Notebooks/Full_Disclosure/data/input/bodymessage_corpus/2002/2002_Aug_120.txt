I don't think the "hide window while away" feature was designed with security in mind. I believe its more for keeping the desktop clear.  Someone with local access could also just as easily turn off away and look at the windows....   ----- Original Message ----- From: "Matthew Murphy" <mattmurphy () kc rr com> To: "BugTraq" <bugtraq () securityfocus com>; "Full Disclosure" <full-disclosure () lists netsys com>; "SecurITeam News" <news () securiteam com>; "Vuln-Dev" <vuln-dev () securityfocus com> Sent: Sunday, August 04, 2002 6:56 PM Subject: AOL Instant Messenger - Away Setting and SnoopersYet another reason never to use AOL...  AOL Instant Messenger is used by many millions of people to send andreceivemessages in real-time.  It features several "states" for a user, such as away, idle, etc. that change the behavior of the client when set.  AOL employs a feature "Hide windows while away" that, as its name implies,hidesall windows in AIM while the user is away.  However, even with windows hidden, it is possible for snoopers to view conversation.  If a user sends you a message while you are away, and regardless of "hide windows" being enabled, the entire conversation between the two parties becomes readable to anyone with access to the terminal just by clickingthedesired screen name.  Example:  1) 2 users chat... 2) user A leaves, setting away status 3) user B checks with a simple "are you there?" type message 4) upon receiving the away, no further messages are exchanged, as user Ahasleft 5) someone with local access checks the away queue for info 6) checking each screen name, he/she saves each transcript 7) user A returns, and responds to the message 8) chat continues...  Workaround: Don't use away state, or close all conversation windows yourself; never use the hide window feature, that is just lazy. :-)  "The reason the mainstream is thought of as a stream is because it is so shallow."                      - Author Unknown
