Issue: Multiple web space providers are susceptible to script-based origin validation attacks. Impact: Cookie theft, page manipulation, ... Additional Information: http://www.murphy.101main.net/vulns/2002-24.txt  Many web space providers offer their users web space by way of a folder-based URL, something like this:  http://www.domain.com/community/uid  An interesting scenario occurs when pages are visited on (commonplace) JavaScript-enabled browsers.  The same-origin policy that is used to avoid cross-frame security violations is completely compromised, as the only difference in these URLs to the browser is folder/virtual paths, not sufficient for a same-origin violation.  This vulnerability allows anyone who can create a webspace account on the host to manipulate the appearance of other hosted sites provided the victim can be coaxed to a page under their control.  This allows for typical cross-domain scripting attacks (stealing cookies, reading form data, ...), which could be pretty devastating, as one site instantly has access to the guts of a few thousand (million?) others.  I have confirmed that Terra Lycos' AngelFire service is vulnerable, and also Yahoo! Geocities is believed susceptible.  It is very likely that others are vulnerable.
