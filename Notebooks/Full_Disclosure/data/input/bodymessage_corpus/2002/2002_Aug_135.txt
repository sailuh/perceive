Without a response from the vendor, we've now got a number of posts in which people have spent extra time to (a) try to figure out the underlying cause of the issue, (b) try to duplicate the issue, and (c) try to come up with a resolution in the absence of vendor guidance and/or a patch.  Vendors often know the answers to these questions.  Greater overall responsiveness by vendors is covered heavily by section 3 of the Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure Process draft [1].  Better responsiveness from vendors (and better coordination overall) can reduce much of this guesswork, so that sysadmins and security researchers can spend their time on more pressing issues.In my opinion bundling bad stuff and good stuff in one document does not make  the whole document good.  When a vendor does not care about security, I simply stop using his product and  don't expect a rfc to protect me and make the vendor a good guy.  Georgi Guninski
