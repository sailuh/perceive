I don't think libcrypto has issues; if it does, make the argument to egrep 'libcrypto libssl'.And  # lsof    egrep 'libcrypto libssl'  or shorter  # lsof    egrep 'libcrypto libssl'   awk '{ print$1 }'   sort   uniq  gives an overview, which current running processes must be restarted afer updating the libraries (and calling ldconfig).IMHO the general problem is recompiling progs which use OpenSSL statically  --  Dimitry
