Due to conflicting results in some tests, I believe that my previous post regarding this issue contained some inaccurate statements:  The root cause of this vulnerability is not a sudden flood of connections; the issue appears to be that Xitami 2.5 Beta does not "clean up" the resources of a connection that has been broken/closed in some cases.  As a result, the vulnerability can be triggered simply by heavy traffic.  Unsetting a limit you may have on HTTP connections will not avoid this vulnerability, and could worsen the affects of any actual overload.  However, systems with limits set will exceed  those limits more quickly.  The vulnerability appears to be present in the way Xitami handles Keep-Alive connections.  Specifically, the server will not close Keep-Alive connections even when appropriate timeouts have been set.
