Latest available is 2.0.39 from 18-Jun-2002 http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/The issue is not with the mod-ssl code in either 1.3 nor 2.0 versions of apache, it's with the openssl code, so upgrade onessl, then recompile you apache which is most likely liked off the openssl stuff.That's ok for *nix systems, but for the Windows platform it's not so easy (I have no Windows compiler here). Also I think that the SSL code in 2.0 has to be linked statically or a OpenSSL lib is included in Apache2 installer. Both results in a recompile/repackage I think.  Comment?
