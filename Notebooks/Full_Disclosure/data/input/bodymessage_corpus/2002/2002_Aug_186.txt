Yeah, that's really a mature way to handle this issue. *cough*  While we're moaning anyway, maybe you can post in plain-text so everybody can read your mail without having to dig through html.  Wouldn't it be possible to block messages which contain the string "out of the office" in the subject to be blocked automatically? and maybe also block html-based messages as well (just look at the 2nd mime part...?)

I vote in favor of auto unsubscribing, kickbanning, mass mailbombing and DoS-ing anybody SPAMming me with this kind of crap. (Just post to bugtraq once and you'll know why.)

Why thank you for telling the list, David.  List: what is the policy on OOO (Out Of Office) replies? Should they be filtered or should one simply be forcefully unsubscribed?    /Thor  ----- Original Message ----- From: ds187 () daimlerchrysler com To: full-disclosure () lists netsys com Sent: Thursday, August 08, 2002 12:03 PM Subject: [Full-disclosure] David Shiner/ITM/DCC/DCX is out of the office.
