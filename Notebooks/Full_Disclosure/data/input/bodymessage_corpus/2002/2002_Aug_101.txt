Last year cotse.com had an errant posting on their archive for bugtraq's mailto.  Below is an injection directly to neohapsis archive. Testing cotse's, possibly the same will show up in the next hour.  http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/vuln-dev/2002-q3/0430.html  the message is happily lifted from humorix.org and modified accordingly.   -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: Hush 2.1 Note: This signature can be verified at https://www.hushtools.com  wmYEARECACYFAj1L7CkfHGNob29zZS5hLnVzZXJuYW1lQGh1c2htYWlsLmNvbQAKCRDT 5JkCl0iMkPGnAJ0VgYJQMJFgWC6SYravPE6sHr0OrQCgl5kNOKT9C6VmQHNM833pW49s 5Jg= =TXt0 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----   Communicate in total privacy.
