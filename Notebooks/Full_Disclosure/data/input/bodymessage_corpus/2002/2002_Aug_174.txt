While for one 10% of the patch cost it's ok (the flop is you kiddo), for other a 0day license should be on the way (that's why an agree from time to time with MS it's hard to get?) ...  This are just GOOD examples of what security is this days ... Probably after all Bill is the only one who is serious in this business, because everybody knows what his company does and for what.

Everyone's in it for a quick buck.   The iDEFENSE Vulnerability Contributor Program  iDEFENSE is a global security intelligence company that proactivelymonitors sources throughout the world <U+0097> from technical vulnerabilities and hacker profiling to the global spread of viruses and other malicious code. iALERT, our security intelligence service, provides decision-makers, frontline security professionals and network administrators with timely access to actionable intelligence and decision support on cyber-related threats.iDEFENSE verifies vulnerabilities, examines the behavior of exploits andother malicious code, and discovers new software/hardware weaknesses in a controlled lab environment. We recognize that there is an abundance of technical security knowledge concerning as-yet-undisclosed vulnerabilities, exploits and malicious code that is constantly discovered and created by individuals and security groups. Some of this information may see the light of day on security mailing lists or are eventually disclosed as the result of a post-mortem analysis of a compromised computer system.iDEFENSE's Vulnerability Contributor Program (VCP) is meant toappropriately pays those who choose to provide advance information and copies of vulnerabilities, exploits and malicious code that could be of interest. Alternately, iDEFENSE can donate the funds to a charity of the contributor<U+0092>s choice in their name.
