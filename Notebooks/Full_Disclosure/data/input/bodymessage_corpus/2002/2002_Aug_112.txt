It could be an  error in Xitami's dynamic-store allocation logic that causes it to fail to reclaim the discarded memory  per connection ?

Because, the maxedout values seem to work quiet fine, the problem is Keep-Alive Connection handling.Yes, I originally thought it was a connection flood because numbers started jumping and then Xitami crashed almost immediately.  However, I was actually seeing the effects of my flood combined with numerous other connections that had "hung open".I don't know how did you actually find out when it has dropped a particular connectionWell, I didn't find out when it was dropping connections, just that it *wasn't* dropping any.  My WinME box btw required an extremely high number of connections to crash (I believe the number was over 450), so production machines will require significantly more connections -- it seems to be a bug-induced resource exhaustion.as in the duration of Keep-Alive affected and it's connection dropping time and whether it matches the value inconfigurations? after how long ?I tried netstat -an frequently by making requests from different hosts onmy network, but same results as i told you before.  I'm still a bit hazy on exactly *where* in the keep-alive handling that Xitami is buggy -- I'm beginning to think that it is not actually related to an open connection, and instead just a bad resource cleanup on the server end._____________________________________________________________ --------------------------- [ATTITUDEX.COM] http://www.attitudex.com/ ---------------------------  _____________________________________________________________ Promote your group and strengthen ties to your members with email () yourgroup org by Everyone.net   http://www.everyone.net/?btn=tag
