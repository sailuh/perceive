I don't use MS software but interested in what changes they made to the EULA.Simply because it may be of some interest to the list, and since I haven't heard it mentioned here, there is a vbs script that will remove the EULA from programs so that you are not required to view or agree to it.  Legal impliations remain to be seen, but if you don't agree, you don't agree.  Code can be found at  http://picket.cc.purdue.edu/~erlee/antieula.html  PJSorry but this sounds plain stupid. How would you convince a judge that you  ran a program designed to remove the EULA, and now that it gone you don't  need to follow it!? The argument seem too easily shut down with common sense.  Why did you run a program designed to remove EULA's in the first place? Of  course he would say you did it to circumvent a legal requirement!   I'd love to see someone who got away with that. One thing would be to remove  it at Microsoft before they implemented it on the CD, or their web site. This  way you could argue that you never received it, and that would be easily  proven. --    Steve Szmidt V.P. Information Technology Video Group Distributors, Inc.
