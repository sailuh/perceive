It's not the  main subject of HP/Snosoft DMCA topic. Here is why:  My knowledge says that there are two major things in engineering: Laws &  Ethical Issues.  First of all observe the following case:  - Assume that a window of a grocery is broken. - Anyone can get something inside without paying at midnight since there  is no glass over there. Normally one would call the police and say to  police that the window is broken and ask for taking precaution otherwise  somebody may take all the banana's and run away. - Laws says that: u'r guilty if u steal something. - Laws also says that : u'r not guilty if u don't call police after  realizing that window is broken.  Let's look what ethic says:  - U'r not ethical if u steal something. - U'r not ethical if u don't call the police.  See? The second line is not ethical but legal.  In DMCA/HP/Snosoft case, the problem is the LAW not the ethical issues.  We must consider these ethical issues later like RFPolicy because HP  already sued SnoSoft according to laws not ethics.  Here is my thoughts about the topic:  There are no laws that states "If it is done at 7 oclock it is legal and  if u do it on 11 o'clock u'll be punished with a ten thousand years in  prison."  This law can't be applied to the real world sorry. We can't prove that  we've already talked with hp at 7 oclock, they didn't answered until 11  clock so I published the exploit code. Unless all vendors are  govermental no legal proof can be stated to court about these  conversations between Vendors and Hackers. Remember they'v got lots of  bucks to give advocates. We'r alone.  I propose two ways to get around:  i. Publish zero-day exploits. Forget about vendor. Since hacking is  illegal, assume police will catch the hacker since he/she's doing  illegal. This is why there are cybercops am I right? Nobody can be  punished if he/she didn't call police in case of a broken window. ii. Hackers are unallowed to publish any exploits. They just can send  the exploit code/bug report to vendor.  Vendor publishes proof of  concept code to public with the fix when available if they want of  course. I think, DMCA will grant this since Vendor's hold the copyright  about the product. Also, we know that no vendor wants to publish that  their product is insecure.  Another topic that i want to discuss is i'm living in Turkiye and here  we don't have any DMCA super duper laws. We have a simple copyright law  which do not include DMCA. Who's gonna stop me publishing 0 day  exploits? Obviously No-One. Right? USA may cancel Turkiye's connection  to USA but i don't think that this is impossible for now. Also, they may  prevent me entering the US frontiers but i really don't care about it.  As a result, only US programmers will suffer from this law not me.  They  are going to think it twice before publishing anything. This is of  course unfair. US goverment just makes their own programmers suffer from  this law by saying "We are protecting the vendors". They are just  missing the statement that "Hackers make their product more secure-more  reliable". I think that they are assuming every vendor has enough  skilled  "Hacker" employee to check their products. Heh:-)) As Kurt  said, they don't have.  In the future, i think, only vendors can publish such exploits, fixes  and proof of concepts in USA. Hackers gonna just take small credit at  the end of the message. For the rest of the world, game is not over and  ppl will continue to publish exploits. Besides, Vendor's will make money  using the works of hackers. This is what we call capitalism in fact and  it is coming over us again. Beware:-))  PS: Heh maybe we should buy a small island and found our "Country of  Secure Systems" and publish exploits from there. Any island suggestions?
