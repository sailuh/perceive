[SNIP]Your number 6 below:  "The Vendor MUST provide a facility for individuals or   organizations who are not Customers to report vulnerabilities"  This to me sounds like it is acceptable that there are going to be vulnerabilities. Continue cranking out shodware because we have a set of guidelines that people who stumble across them are expected to adhere to.Vulnerabilities will happen, even in the best of circumstances, as long as new types of vulnerabilities are discovered.  If there are 20 individuals who decide to audit a package for a new type of vulnerability, but the vendor only has 5 developers, then it seems like there's a good chance that someone other than the vendor will discover the issue.  Then you've got "interaction" vulnerabilities, which I loosely define as when a vulnerability occurs in the way that two products interact with each other.  Developers can't always predict how their product will be used, or how it will interact with other products, so interaction-based vulnerabilities may be around in one form or another.But seriously, what's new about buffer overflows, which are the main cause of vunls in software now as they were in the 1980's and prior when the morris worm hit[1].  How about repeat issue with the same products, like the M$ sql server issues <not that M$ is the only vendor with products that sink time and again>?   What 'new types of vulnerabilities' are being discovered?
