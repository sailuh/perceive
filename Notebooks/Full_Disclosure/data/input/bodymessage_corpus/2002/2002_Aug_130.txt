Muhammad Faisal Rauf Danka <mfrd () attitudex com> asked:What is vendor's status regarding this issue?to which "Matthew Murphy" <mattmurphy () kc rr com> replied:I've e-mailed the vendor, but have received no response *at all*.This thread is a good demonstration for why vendors need to be responsive to incoming vulnerability reports.  Without a response from the vendor, we've now got a number of posts in which people have spent extra time to (a) try to figure out the underlying cause of the issue, (b) try to duplicate the issue, and (c) try to come up with a resolution in the absence of vendor guidance and/or a patch.  Vendors often know the answers to these questions.  Greater overall responsiveness by vendors is covered heavily by section 3 of the Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure Process draft [1].  Better responsiveness from vendors (and better coordination overall) can reduce much of this guesswork, so that sysadmins and security researchers can spend their time on more pressing issues.  - Steve   [1] http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-christey-wysopal-vuln-disclosure-00.txt
