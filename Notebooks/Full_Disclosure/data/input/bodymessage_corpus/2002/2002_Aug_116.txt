i fail to see the importance of this.  the hide window option is primarily for preventing full screen applications (particularly games) from crashing or switching to the desktop when another user messages you.  i highly doubt the hide window option is intended for any security purposes.  if you're conserned with people viewing your screen, lock it with a screensaver or nt/2k/xp "lock" feature."Hide window" stops people from viewing your windows.  With this, somebody *could* view your window.  It really is a matter of information disclosure -- do I need to see three pages of chat to tell me the relevance of 2 messages while I'm away?  Not likely...
