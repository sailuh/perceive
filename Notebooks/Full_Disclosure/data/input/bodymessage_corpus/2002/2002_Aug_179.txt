-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1  This all after the fact. These names and labels are assigned once the deed is done.  It cannot be like that.  More importantly you need to define what a "vulnerabililty" is otherwise no matter what your guidline says or suggests,  without that definition we could be talking magic tricks.The current short definition of "reporter/notifier" is:    A [Reporter/Notifier] is the individual or organization that   informs (or attempts to inform) the Vendor of the vulnerability.   Note that the [Reporter/Notifier] may not have been the initial   discoverer of the problem.  The current draft doesn't include any definition of "security advisory," so that will need to be addressed.
