How would you convince a judgethatyou ran a program designed to remove the EULA, and now that it goneyoudon't need to follow it!?I think the rationale is, it's not an "agreement" if you didn't agree. There is no pretense that you were unaware of the EULA.  Just that you never agreed to it.  Conditions presented after the sale are (or should be) unenforceable. Especially things like MS has added to their EULA for W2K SP3.  This is clearly changing the conditions after the sale.  The question is, do they have a right to refuse to fix defects in an already-purchased product unless you agree to new terms and conditions.  Legally I'm not sure, but ethically it is pretty clear.  They are trying to bully their customers.  Typical monopolist behavior.  And especially blatant, given the current barrage of lawsuits against them on this subject.
