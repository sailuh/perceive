The BIND distribution provides Internet domain name service known as DNS thru a daemon called named.  ISC and CERT have reported several vulnerabilities discovered in certain versions of BIND distributions.  These vulnerabilities can be used to perform denial of service attacks and/or to obtain privileged access remotely.  SGI has investigated the issue and provides the following information for=  customer interpretation and possible action.   - -------------- - --- Impact --- - --------------  SGI distributes BIND based on version 4.9.4 patchlevel 1 with IRIX 6.5, but it is not installed by default.  It is part of the package eoe.sw.nam= ed.  To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following command:    # uname -R  That will return a result similar to the following:    # 6.5 6.5.16f  The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.16f" in th= is case) is the extended release name.  The extended release name is the "version" we refer to throughout this document.  To see if BIND is installed, execute the following command:  % versions eoe.sw.named I =3D Installed, R =3D Removed     Name                 Date        Description     I  eoe                  12/12/2001  IRIX Execution Environment, 6.5.14= f    I  eoe.sw               12/12/2001  IRIX Execution Environment Softwar= e    I  eoe.sw.named         12/12/2001  Berkeley Internet Name Domain Serv= er   These vulnerabilities were reported by Internet Software Consortium (ISC)= : http://www.isc.org/products/BIND/bind-security-19991108.html  These vulnerabilities were also reported by CERT(sm) in Advisory CA-1999-= 14: http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1999-14.html  The denial of service in BIND named via maxdname was assigned CVE: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=3DCVE-1999-0849  The denial of service in BIND named via naptr was assigned CVE: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=3DCVE-1999-0851  These vulnerabilities have been publicly discussed in public Usenet newsgroups and Internet mailing lists.   - -------------------------- - --- Temporary Solution --- - --------------------------  Unfortunately, there are no immediate or temporary workarounds for this issue if you need to run a local nameserver.  SGI recommends either installing the appropriate patch from the list below or upgrading to IRIX=  6.5.18 when it is released.   - ---------------- - --- Solution --- - ----------------  SGI has provided a patch for these vulnerabilities. Our recommendation is=  to upgrade to IRIX 6.5.18 when available, or install the appropriate patch.  This patch updates BIND to version 4.9.8 patchlevel 1 and provides a chroot jail option for named.      OS Version     Vulnerable?
