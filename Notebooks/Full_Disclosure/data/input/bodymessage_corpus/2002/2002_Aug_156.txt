I thought this was as widely known as the ability to spoof the senderaddress in emails. Like you said: "The same-origin >policy that is used to avoid cross-frame security violations is completely compromised" because it all comes from the same >origin.Maybe people just don't know, but i've known this since I first learnedabout browser script security.  I would far rather provide information that you can simply skip over than not provide that information and leave someone else confused.  Therefore, I aim to provide as much info as possible and let the (informed) user decide what to do.
