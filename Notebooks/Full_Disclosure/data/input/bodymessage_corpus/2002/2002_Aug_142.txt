I said:This thread is a good demonstration for why vendors need to be responsive to incoming vulnerability reports... Greater overall responsiveness by vendors is covered heavily by section 3 of the Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure Process draftGeorgi Guninski said:In my opinion bundling bad stuff and good stuff in one document does not make the whole document good.I hope that we can restructure the next version of the document so that recommendations for vendor responsiveness are somewhat separate from the proposed disclosure process.  That way, vulnerability researchers/notifiers could point to particular parts of the disclosure document to give them some "backup," even if they do not agree with other parts of the document.  - Steve
