How would you convince a judge that you  ran a program designed to remove the EULA, and now that it gone you don't  need to follow it!? The argument seem too easily shut down with common sense.  Why did you run a program designed to remove EULA's in the first place? Of  course he would say you did it to circumvent a legal requirement!The point is that you are not legally required to sign or agree with a contract that is simply presented in front of you, if you don't agree to it, you can negotiate the points in contention, refuse to sign or make your own addumenum before presenting it to the other party.  Now, since you have already paid your money and are not presented with the EULA until you start installing, this removes the need to actually agree with whatever terms are presented to you after the fact.  The point is, since you never agreed to it, you are not legally obliged to follow it.  Previously, the only way to install is to agree to whatever.  This removes that need.  I would have thought this point obvious.I'd love to see someone who got away with that. One thing would be to remove  it at Microsoft before they implemented it on the CD, or their web site. This  way you could argue that you never received it, and that would be easily  proven.If I am not mistaken, an EULA has never been tested in a court of law. Of course, as noted, regular copyright law would still apply.  PJ  --  When you play, play to your own strengths, not the strengths of the enemy.
