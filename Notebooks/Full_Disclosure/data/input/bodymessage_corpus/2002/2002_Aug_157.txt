Now, since you have already paid your money and are not presented with the EULA until you start installing, this removes the need to actually agree with whatever terms are presented to you after the fact.All CD's are sealed, and if you open the seal, you agree with the EULA. Hmmm ... but you can open the CD case on the other side, without breaking the seal ... Don't know, how that would be regarding laws ... (because it is easy to do so, you don't even have to break anything, if it is a standard jewel case)  regards, Markus Gaugusch
