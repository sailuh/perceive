It's not the=20 main subject of HP/Snosoft DMCA topic. Here is why: =20 My knowledge says that there are two major things in engineering: Law=s &=20Ethical Issues. =20 First of all observe the following case: =20 - Assume that a window of a grocery is broken. - Anyone can get something inside without paying at midnight since th=ere=20is no glass over there. Normally one would call the police and say to==20police that the window is broken and ask for taking precaution otherw=ise=20somebody may take all the banana's and run away. - Laws says that: u'r guilty if u steal something. - Laws also says that : u'r not guilty if u don't call police after=20 realizing that window is broken. =20 Let's look what ethic says: =20 - U'r not ethical if u steal something. - U'r not ethical if u don't call the police. =20 See? The second line is not ethical but legal. =20 In DMCA/HP/Snosoft case, the problem is the LAW not the ethical issue=s.=20We must consider these ethical issues later like RFPolicy because HP=20 already sued SnoSoft according to laws not ethics. =20 Here is my thoughts about the topic: =20 There are no laws that states "If it is done at 7 oclock it is legal =and=20if u do it on 11 o'clock u'll be punished with a ten thousand years i=n=20prison." =20 This law can't be applied to the real world sorry. We can't prove tha=t=20we've already talked with hp at 7 oclock, they didn't answered until =11=20clock so I published the exploit code. Unless all vendors are=20 govermental no legal proof can be stated to court about these=20 conversations between Vendors and Hackers. Remember they'v got lots o=f=20bucks to give advocates. We'r alone. =20 I propose two ways to get around: =20 i. Publish zero-day exploits. Forget about vendor. Since hacking is=20 illegal, assume police will catch the hacker since he/she's doing=20 illegal. This is why there are cybercops am I right? Nobody can be=20 punished if he/she didn't call police in case of a broken window. ii. Hackers are unallowed to publish any exploits. They just can send==20the exploit code/bug report to vendor.  Vendor publishes proof of=20 concept code to public with the fix when available if they want of=20 course. I think, DMCA will grant this since Vendor's hold the copyrig=ht=20about the product. Also, we know that no vendor wants to publish that==20their product is insecure. =20 Another topic that i want to discuss is i'm living in Turkiye and her=e=20we don't have any DMCA super duper laws. We have a simple copyright l=aw=20which do not include DMCA. Who's gonna stop me publishing 0 day=20 exploits? Obviously No-One. Right? USA may cancel Turkiye's connectio=n=20to USA but i don't think that this is impossible for now. Also, they =may=20prevent me entering the US frontiers but i really don't care about it=.=20 As a result, only US programmers will suffer from this law not me.  T=hey=20are going to think it twice before publishing anything. This is of=20 course unfair. US goverment just makes their own programmers suffer f=rom=20this law by saying "We are protecting the vendors". They are just=20 missing the statement that "Hackers make their product more secure-mo=re=20reliable". I think that they are assuming every vendor has enough=20 skilled  "Hacker" employee to check their products. Heh:-)) As Kurt=20 said, they don't have. =20 In the future, i think, only vendors can publish such exploits, fixes==20and proof of concepts in USA. Hackers gonna just take small credit at==20the end of the message. For the rest of the world, game is not over a=nd=20ppl will continue to publish exploits. Besides, Vendor's will make mo=ney=20using the works of hackers. This is what we call capitalism in fact a=nd=20it is coming over us again. Beware:-)) =20 PS: Heh maybe we should buy a small island and found our "Country of=20 Secure Systems" and publish exploits from there.
