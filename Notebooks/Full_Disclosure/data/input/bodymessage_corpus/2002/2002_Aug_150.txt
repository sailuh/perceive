Like you said: "The same-origin policy that is us= ed to avoid cross-frame security violations is completely compromised" because it=  all comes from the same origin.  Maybe people just don't know, but i've known this since I first learn= ed about browser script security.  Berend-Jan Wever aka SkyLined   http://spoor12.edup.tudelft.nl   ----- Original Message -----=20   From: Matthew Murphy=20   To: Vuln-Dev ; SecurITeam News ; Full Disclosure ; BugTraq=20   Sent: Tuesday, August 06, 2002 6:19   Subject: [Full-disclosure] Cross-Site Scripting Attacks Possible At=  Multiple Webspace Provid ers     Issue: Multiple web space providers are susceptible to script-based=  origin   validation attacks.   Impact: Cookie theft, page manipulation, ...   Additional Information: http://www.murphy.101main.net/vulns/2002-24= .txt    Many web space providers offer their users web space by way of a   folder-based URL, something like this:    http://www.domain.com/community/uid    An interesting scenario occurs when pages are visited on (commonpla= ce)   JavaScript-enabled browsers.  The same-origin policy that is used t= o avoid   cross-frame security violations is completely compromised, as the o= nly   difference in these URLs to the browser is folder/virtual paths, no= t   sufficient for a same-origin violation.  This vulnerability allows = anyone   who can create a webspace account on the host to manipulate the app= earance   of other hosted sites provided the victim can be coaxed to a page u= nder   their control.    This allows for typical cross-domain scripting attacks (stealing co= okies,   reading form data, ...), which could be pretty devastating, as one = site   instantly has access to the guts of a few thousand (million?) other= s.    I have confirmed that Terra Lycos' AngelFire service is vulnerable,=  and also   Yahoo! Geocities is believed susceptible.  It is very likely that o= thers are   vulnerable.
